Boston Housing Price Prediction
Overview
This project uses Linear Regression to predict housing prices based on the Boston Housing dataset from Kaggle. It includes data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

Project Structure
House_Price_Prediction_Boston.ipynb – Main notebook with complete workflow

BostonHousing.csv – Dataset used for training and testing

README.md – Project documentation

.gitignore – Python-specific exclusions

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/svimaladevi9503/BostonHousing.git
cd BostonHousing
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells sequentially.

Workflow Summary
Upload and read the dataset using Pandas

Check for missing values and visualize correlations using Seaborn heatmaps

Split the data into features (x) and target (y)

Perform train-test split with scikit-learn

Standardize features using StandardScaler

Train a LinearRegression model

Predict housing prices and evaluate using custom accuracy function (R², MSE, RMSE, MAE)

Handle missing values using SimpleImputer

Model Evaluation Metrics
R² Score

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Future Enhancements
Add support for other regression models (Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree)

Visualize prediction results

Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask
